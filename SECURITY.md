## Known Security Considerations

### Electron Security

Simnote is built with Electron and follows these security practices:

- **Context Isolation**: Enabled to prevent code injection
- **Node Integration**: Disabled in renderer processes
- **Preload Scripts**: Used for secure IPC communication
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented to prevent XSS attacks

### Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: Entries are stored locally on your device
- **No Cloud Sync**: Data doesn't leave your device by default
- **File Permissions**: Entry files have restricted access permissions

### Third-Party Dependencies

- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated
- **Security Audits**: We use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Dependencies**: We keep third-party dependencies to a minimum

## Secure Configuration

### Recommended Settings

```javascript
// Secure BrowserWindow configuration
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    nodeIntegration: false,          // Disable Node.js integration
    contextIsolation: true,          // Enable context isolation
    enableRemoteModule: false,       // Disable remote module
    allowRunningInsecureContent: false,
    experimentalFeatures: false,
    webSecurity: true,              // Enable web security
    preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js')
  }
});
```

### Content Security Policy
